# UI_API_automation_Test
management of automation tools, both API (services), such as websites. I made it with IntellJ IDE.

Test automation to UI web page where the user can choose some products like dresses and then add to cart to finally buy it. To get the acces to YOUR LOG Web page, the user will need to be registered and then sign in to buy with the previous account.

You are going to find the SERENITY_REST implementation to test the API and the encoding point of a service. All the automations you are going to see use BDD, SCREEN PLAY, CUCUMBER, GHERKING. Thanks for reading.
